# My personal website

This repository hosts the code I developed to build my personal website. 

With no previous experience in HTML, CSS, or website design, I took this project as an opportunity for learning new skills and having fun. 

#### October 2023

I saw that a lot of people in academia have their own website. A little bit bored during a rainy day, I took a pencil and jokingly drafted a sketch of my possible website. That soon translated into a Canva project. 

Yeah that would be cool, I thought, but I don't have the skills to build an actual website... right? Right, I did not have them... yet. 

In the meantime, my mind is crowded with a lot of questions. How do you create a website? Are there some rules for designing it? How do you publish it on the internet? How can you ensure that it works on all devices? 

To silence all these thoughts, I did what I do best: watch YouTube videos. At first, I heard that you can easily create and host your website with no coding needed. The catch is that you need to regularly pay a fee to some online services. Being frugal by nature (and a PhD student) that was not appealing nor interesting to me.  

I then learned that you can code a website using HTML, CSS, and occasionally Java, and host it on GitHub Pages. All of that is for free. The catch is that you need to be skilled at coding and be familiar with GitHub. Was I an expert in those three programming languages? Never seen them before. Was I able to use GitHub? Not really. Did I start the project anyways? For sure. 

I created a folder in my computer with two blank files: `index.html` and `styles.css`. That's what everyone on YouTube was telling me to do. Also created a GitHub repository for the project. 

I started coding something, while getting familiar with the two programming languages on the go. At every step, I was more and more amazed of how many beautiful designs and animations you can create with just two files and some lines of code. 

I learned about navigation bars, footers, links, multiple pages, animations... and then responsiveness. That was a tricky part, but I hope I have handled it decently, and definitely learned a lot from it. I will never look at webpages the same way again after knowing what goes in building them.

The website was slowly continuing to grow and evolve. I could only use evenings or spare time to work on it, but every time I added a brick it was a learning opportunity and a pride after seeing the result. 

#### December 2024

The first version of the website is finished!
