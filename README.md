# My personal website

This repository hosts the code I developed to build my personal website. 

With no previous experience in HTML, CSS, or website design, I took this project as an opportunity for learning new skills and having fun. 

In October 2023, I started learning about HTML and CSS during my spare time. In December 2023, the first version of the website was finished and published online.
